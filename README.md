# An app all about the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, postponed to Summer 2021!

## Background

Building a flippable trading card app featuring all the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics sporting events following [Microsoft Build session](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/e6809457-5189-4442-99d7-a7ea45649c19?source=schedule) with [Jen Looper](https://www.jenlooper.com/). Remix [Olympics sports](https://olympics.com/en/sports/summer-olympics) on a page.

- Mobile friendly, responsive design

## Original Background

This is the Student Branch of the Olympic App, which we can build together at Microsoft Build. Welcome, students and learners of all type.

To get started, fork this version of the app and open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Look for the medal emoji to follow the steps and build this app. The complete app is built on the 'main' branch.

To launch the app, type: `npm i` to install dependencies. Then, type `npm run dev` to run the app locally (usually on localhost:3000). Since the app only uses Vite and no other framework, your dependency install is lightweight.

Using Vite, Vanilla JS, and CSS Grid, let's create a card-flipping app!

Vite will handle the architecture and module bundling, we will use Vanilla JS to avoid framework fatigue, and use CSS Grid for responsive design needs. The actual card flipping can be done using plain old CSS transforms.
